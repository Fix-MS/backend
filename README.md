# Fix-MS Backend

This is the backend part of our [Münsterhack](https://muensterhack.de/) 2022 project "Fix-MS", which aims to provide nicer UI for the _flaw report form_ ([Mängelmeldung-Formular](https://www.stadt-muenster.de/maengelmeldung)) provided by the city of Münster. Essentially this part of the solution is going to accept user input from other parts (apps etc.) and forward the submitted issues to the city administration.
